welcome! this is a project I've been working on for a couple of months on and off, and I plan to update it with any future additions that I make.

the included files are intended to be used as a set of tools for common orbital mechanics problems, including Lambert's problem and Kepler's problem.
some of the included features can be found as web applications in my other repos, including the lambert-plotter and porkchop-plotter streamlit apps.
feel free to use any code here for any purpose, and please reach out to me if anything breaks (bradylawrence622@gmail.com)
